    <h2>Art+Tech</h2>
    <p>Open sharing of methods and materials has been a part of art-making since the invention of pigments for painting the walls of caves.</p>
    <p>Today, technology is expanding the boundaries of art in ways that were previously unimaginable. Open source hardware and software has become a foundational building block for a new wave of creative practices, enabling artists and inventors to stand on the shoulders of giants, building on top of emerging platforms and even inventing their own tools.</p>
    <p>As part of <a href="https://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au 2019</a>, we are presenting this one-day, one-track miniconf, exploring the creative and expressive uses of technology to make things that are beautiful, interesting, surprising and sometimes even useful.</p>
    <h2>Call for Speakers</h2>
    <p>We’re looking for talks from artists, engineers, scientists and crafters who are using open source technologies in areas such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>computational creativity</li>
      <li>generative and data-driven art</li>
      <li>audio synthesis and music production</li>
      <li>videogames, art toys and interactive fiction</li>
      <li>textiles, fashion design, traditional arts and crafts</li>
      <li>augmented, mixed, and virtual reality</li>
      <li>3-D printing, electronics, robotics</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exhbition</h2>
    <p>Alongside the talks, we are planning a pop-up exhibition of artworks and projects from the miniconf speakers, giving conference attendees an opportunity to explore the works up close and talk to the artists and makers.</p>
    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    <p>Coming soon. Submit a talk proposal via </p>
    <h2>Tickets &amp; Financial Assistance</h2>
    <p><a href="https://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a> is a community run conference. All presenters are required to purchase a ticket to attend. We are working with the organisers to potentially make a ‘miniconf only’ ticket available but we are unable to confirm this yet.</p>
    <p>There may also be limited financial assistance available to cover expenses for speakers. We will try to accommodate as many requests for assistance as possible within our limited budget.</p>
